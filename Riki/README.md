### About
Stage A version of Wiki440 system for CSC440:
    - WIki System utilizes Stage A PIP libraries to implement Stage B features for login system to prove that libraries
    have ported the functionality to modify users.json file simply by defining your own route and then pulling in the 
    `create_user` or `delete_user` API from the PIP library.
    
### Unittests
Unittests follow a similar format from Stage B to attempt to prove that Stage A features are working as intended. Unittests 
are the `test_user_add_delete.py` file in `tests` directory.
